# Virtual Extream Access - VXACCESS

## Abstract/Description
Our project aims to create an Automated Approval Application that simplifies the fee payment and No Objection Certificate (NOC) approval process for students in engineering colleges. With this app, students can complete necessary administrative tasks like paying fees, requesting approvals from various departments, and downloading hall tickets, all without having to visit the college physically. This digital system saves time, reduces paperwork, and allows students to focus more on their academics.
